# Local LLM Tool-Calling Benchmark Report (Round 2)

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Models:** 21 (11 original + 10 community-requested)
**Runs:** 3 per model/prompt combination (756 total inference calls)
**Hardware:** CPU-only (no GPU acceleration)

## Machine Specs

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 w/ Radeon 860M |
| Cores / Threads | 8 cores / 16 threads |
| Architecture | x86_64 (Zen 5, Strix Point) |
| CPU Max Clock | 2.0 GHz (boost-enabled) |
| RAM | 32 GB DDR5 (30 Gi usable) |
| GPU | Integrated Radeon 860M (not used for inference) |
| OS | Arch Linux, kernel 6.18.3-arch1-1 |
| ISA Extensions | AVX-512, AVX2, SSE4.2 |

All inference ran on CPU only. Ollama models use llama.cpp under the hood with Q4_K_M quantization by default. BitNet models use Microsoft's bitnet.cpp with native 1.58-bit (I2_S) kernels.

## What Changed from Round 1

Round 2 uses the same benchmark design as Round 1 (same 12 prompts, same scoring formula, same test harness). The only changes are:

1. **10 new models** added from community requests on [the Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qyg10z/) (163 upvotes, 68 comments).
2. **All models rerun fresh** (3 runs each). Original model scores may differ from Round 1 due to run-to-run variance. See [Score Changes for Original Models](#score-changes-for-original-models) for details.
3. **New backend: llama.cpp** added for models not available through Ollama (LFM2.5).
4. **`think=False` added** to the raw-schema backend to handle thinking-mode models (Qwen3-based) that otherwise produce empty content fields.
5. **Fallback tool-call parsers** added for non-standard output formats. Three rounds of parser improvements were made:
   - **Round 1:** jan-v3:4b outputs valid JSON but omits the opening `<tool_call>` tag; lfm2.5:1.2b uses bracket notation (`[fn(args)]`). Added bare-JSON and bracket-notation fallbacks.
   - **Round 2:** gemma3:1b uses function-call syntax inside `<tool_call>` tags (`<tool_call>get_weather(city: Antwerp)</tool_call>`); deepseek-r1:1.5b outputs bare function calls with no tags (`get_weather(Antwerp)`); smollm3:3b sometimes omits tags entirely. Added function-call-in-tags parser, bare function-call parser (restricted to known tool names), and markdown code-fence stripping.
   All fallbacks only fire when the primary `<tool_call>` JSON parser fails, so existing model behavior is unchanged. See [Parser Improvements](#parser-improvements) for details.

### Models Attempted but Not Included

| Model | Reason |
|---|---|
| DeepBrainz-R1-2B | Community GGUF (mradermacher) outputs Thai/garbage text. Model appears broken at the quantization level. |
| Gemma 3n (e2b) | 5.6 GB download, exceeds the scope of this small-model benchmark. |

### Backend Details

Four inference backends were used:

- **Ollama (native tools):** Models that support Ollama's built-in `tools=` parameter. The API handles tool schema injection and structured output parsing natively.
- **Ollama (raw prompt):** Models that don't support Ollama's native tool API. A system prompt embedding the tool schemas is sent via `ollama.chat()` without `tools=`, and `<tool_call>{"name": ..., "arguments": ...}</tool_call>` tags are parsed from the plain-text response.
- **llama.cpp (raw prompt):** Stock llama.cpp `llama-server` running as a subprocess. Same raw-prompt-and-parse approach, using the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Used for models not available through Ollama.
- **BitNet (llama-server):** Microsoft's bitnet.cpp `llama-server`. Same raw-prompt approach on port 8921.

New in Round 2: smollm3:3b doesn't support Ollama's native tool API (returns HTTP 400) and was moved to raw prompt. jan-v3:4b supports the native API but produces empty content when thinking is enabled; it was moved to raw prompt with `think=False` to get usable output.

### Parser Improvements

The parser was improved in two rounds to handle five non-standard output formats. The goal: measure whether models call the right tool, not whether they emit the right XML tags.

**Round 1 fixes** (jan-v3 and lfm2.5):

**jan-v3:4b** outputs valid JSON but omits the opening `<tool_call>` tag:
```
{"name": "get_weather", "arguments": {"city": "Antwerp"}}
</tool_call>
```

**lfm2.5:1.2b** uses Python-style bracket notation:
```
[get_weather(city="Antwerp")]I am retrieving the current weather...
```

Two fallback parsers were added: bare-JSON detection (brace-counting) and bracket-notation parsing (parenthesis-counting with keyword arguments).

**Round 2 fixes** (gemma3, deepseek-r1, smollm3):

**gemma3:1b** uses function-call syntax *inside* `<tool_call>` tags instead of JSON:
```
<tool_call>get_weather(city: Antwerp)</tool_call>
<tool_call>search_files(pattern: "*.py")</tool_call>
```

**deepseek-r1:1.5b** outputs bare function calls with no tags at all:
```
get_weather(Antwerp)
schedule_meeting("Sprint Review", "2025-02-10T14:00:00")
```

**smollm3:3b** sometimes embeds valid JSON or function calls in its text response without `<tool_call>` tags.

Three additional parsers were added: function-call-in-tags (when `<tool_call>` is found but content isn't JSON), bare function-call (restricted to known tool names to avoid matching Python code), and markdown code-fence stripping. The bare funcall parser includes guards against false positives: it skips Python definitions (`def get_weather(city)`), assignments (`result = get_weather(...)`), method calls (`self.get_weather(...)`), type signatures (`get_weather(city: string)`), and placeholder values (`get_weather(city: city_name)`).

All fallbacks are layered: `<tool_call>` JSON → funcall-in-tags → bare JSON → bracket notation → bare funcall. Each fires only if the previous found nothing.

**Combined impact across both rounds:**
- **lfm2.5:1.2b**: 0.640 → **0.880** (Action 0.100 → 0.700). Rank 13 → tied #1.
- **jan-v3:4b**: 0.490 → **0.560** (Action 0.100 → 0.900). Format fix revealed zero restraint as the real problem.
- **deepseek-r1:1.5b**: 0.600 → **0.720** (Action 0.000 → 0.300). Format fix revealed inconsistent but genuinely capable tool calling with perfect restraint.
- **gemma3:1b**: 0.600 → **0.550** (Action 0.000 → 0.500). Format fix revealed trigger-happy behavior -- the model calls tools on restraint prompts (P5) and picks wrong tools on P10/P12. The old parser's blindness was *flattering* its restraint score.
- **smollm3:3b**: 0.740 → **0.710** (Action 0.600 → 0.900). Improved parsing of bare funcalls revealed P5 restraint failures and incorrect P12 calls, slightly offsetting the action gains.

## Scoring

Unchanged from Round 1. Five metrics capture independent capabilities:

- **Action Score** = correct_tool_calls / 10. How many of the 10 actionable prompts (P1-P4, P6-P8, P10-P12) produced valid tool calls with the correct tool.
- **Restraint Score** = correct_refusals / 2. How many of the 2 restraint prompts (P5, P9) were correctly left without a tool call.
- **Wrong Tool** = count of specifically-bad tool calls on P10-P12 (range: 0-3).
- **Reliability** = average per-prompt (successful_runs / 3), computed before majority voting.
- **Multi-Tool Accuracy** = correct_tools / required_tools for P8 only. N/A for native-tools models (Ollama returns only the first tool call).
- **Agent Score** = Action x 0.4 + Restraint x 0.3 + Wrong-Tool-Avoidance x 0.3, where Wrong-Tool-Avoidance = (3 - wrong_tool_count) / 3.

Results averaged across 3 runs using majority voting.

**Legend:** "OK" = correct tool. "WRONG" = called the specifically-bad tool (penalized). "wrong?" = wrong tool but not the worst choice (not penalized). "miss" = didn't call any tool (no penalty, but no Action credit).

## New Model Analysis

### The Qwen3 Family: Thinking Meets Tool Calling

Qwen3 was the most-requested model family (6 separate users). Three sizes were tested: 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B. All three use Ollama's native tool API and have built-in thinking capability.

**qwen3:0.6b (0.6B params) -- New Champion, 600 Million Parameters**

The smallest Qwen3 tied for the highest Agent Score in the benchmark (0.880), matching the 4B variant while being 17x faster (3,645 ms vs 63,717 ms average). Perfect restraint on P5 and P9. Zero wrong tool calls. It correctly called `search_files` on P11 (resisting the "weather" keyword trap), showing negation comprehension at a parameter count where most models fail.

Where it falls short: P10 (cycling in Bruges) and P12 (scheduling despite provided weather) were both declined rather than attempted. The model's strategy mirrors qwen2.5:1.5b from Round 1 -- when uncertain, don't act. This conservatism is rewarded by the scoring formula.

On P12, the model showed inconsistency across runs: Run 1 correctly called `schedule_meeting`, but Runs 2 and 3 declined. In one run it even stated "The current tools don't include a function to schedule a meeting" -- contradicting its own tool list. At 600M parameters, working memory for tool schemas appears fragile.

**qwen3:4b (4B params) -- Same Score, 17x Slower**

Tied at 0.880 with identical behavior to the 0.6B on majority-voted results: perfect restraint, zero wrong tools, same P10/P12 misses. The difference is latency. Thinking mode generates extensive reasoning chains that balloon inference time: P7 took 148 seconds, P12 took 162 seconds.

The thinking traces reveal sophisticated reasoning. On P12, the model correctly identified that weather was already provided and that `schedule_meeting` was the right tool, but then concluded it couldn't call the tool because no meeting time was specified:

> "The user's request to schedule a meeting requires a specific time (which is not provided in the query), making it impossible to call the `schedule_meeting` function."

This is technically a valid objection -- the prompt says "Should I schedule an indoor meeting with Jan?" without specifying a time. The model chose not to act rather than hallucinate a time. On P10, similar reasoning: it noted that `get_weather` returns current weather, not forecasts, making it unreliable for a "next Thursday" decision.

Whether this represents superior reasoning or excessive caution depends on the deployment context. The benchmark penalizes inaction (Action 0.700), but in production an agent that refuses impossible tasks may be preferable to one that hallucinates parameters.

**qwen3:1.7b (1.7B params) -- The Middle Child Problem**

The 1.7B scored 0.670, significantly lower than both its siblings. The culprit: P9 restraint failure. When asked to write a Python weather script, it called `get_weather("Antwerp")` in 2 of 3 runs -- keyword-triggered by "weather" in the prompt, the same failure pattern that affected qwen2.5:3b in Round 1.

The model also called `get_weather` on P12 (weather already provided), earning 1 wrong tool penalty. Combined with the restraint failure: 0.800 x 0.4 + 0.500 x 0.3 + 0.667 x 0.3 = 0.670.

This creates a non-monotonic relationship within the Qwen3 family: 0.6B (0.880) > 4B (0.880) > 1.7B (0.670). The 1.7B model appears to sit in a capability valley -- large enough to be aggressive about tool calling, but not large enough to exercise judgment about when not to. The 0.6B model's conservatism and the 4B model's reasoning both avoid the trap that catches the 1.7B.

Latency is also notably high for its size: 11,903 ms average, driven by thinking chains. P7 took 19.5 seconds and P9 took 44.7 seconds.

### functiongemma (270M) -- Purpose-Built, Still Keyword-Trapped

The most anticipated model in Round 2: a 270M fine-tune specifically designed for function calling. Two users predicted it would have "very high performance per compute." At 476 ms average latency, it's the fastest model in the benchmark by a wide margin.

Agent Score: 0.640. It nailed the basics (P1-P3, P7 all correct) and showed perfect restraint on P5 and P9. But on the hard prompts it fell into the same keyword trap as models seven times its size:

- P11: Called `get_weather("Antwerp")` despite being told "don't check the weather." The negation was completely ignored.
- P12: Called `get_weather("Antwerp")` despite the weather being provided in the prompt. Also called `schedule_meeting` in the same response, showing the correct intent was present but secondary to the keyword trigger.

At 270M parameters, functiongemma has the smallest model in the benchmark that can produce valid tool calls. Its restraint is excellent -- it correctly declined P5, P9, and P10 (all three). But it cannot parse negation or detect redundant information. These are the same failures that affect qwen2.5:0.5b (500M), suggesting a capability floor around 500M-1B parameters for contextual tool selection.

### granite4:3b (3B) -- IBM's Quiet Achiever

IBM's latest Granite generation scored 0.670, with a strong Action Score (0.800) and solid hard-prompt performance. It correctly called `get_weather("Bruges")` on P10 (implicit weather reasoning) and `search_files` on P11 (negation comprehension) -- only 5 models in the benchmark pass both.

The single failure: P12, where it called `get_weather("Antwerp")` despite the weather being provided. This is the most common failure across all models.

Its P9 restraint failure (calling `get_weather("San Francisco")` when asked to write a Python weather script) is notable for the consistent hallucinated city across all 3 runs. The model doesn't generate any `raw_content` text for most responses -- it's a pure tool-calling machine that either calls a tool or returns nothing. The one exception is P5 (meta question), where it produced a well-formatted markdown table listing its tools.

The comparison with granite3.3:2b (0.480) is stark. Both are IBM models, but granite4 shows dramatically better judgment: granite3.3 has zero restraint (calls tools on every prompt including P5 and P9), while granite4 passes P5 and shows contextual awareness on P10-P11.

### smollm3:3b (3B) -- Better Parser Reveals the Full Picture

HuggingFace's SmolLM3 initially scored 0.740 with the original parser. After adding the bare function-call and code-fence-stripping parsers, it shifted to **0.710** -- slightly *lower* despite parsing more tool calls.

The paradox: the improved parser now detects tool calls that were previously invisible, which raised Action from 0.600 to 0.900 (9 of 10 actionable prompts). But it also revealed that the model calls tools on P5 (the "what tools do you have?" restraint prompt) in some runs, dropping Restraint from 1.000 to 0.500. The net effect: higher action, lower restraint, and a slightly worse composite score. The old parser was accidentally flattering its restraint by failing to see the P5 tool calls.

The model's `<think>` blocks remain its most distinctive feature. On P5, the reasoning varies between runs: sometimes it correctly reasons "this is not a request to perform a task" and lists tools in text, other times it outputs `get_weather(city: string)` descriptions that the parser now detects as function calls.

On P10, the model now correctly calls `get_weather("Bruges")` -- one of the calls previously hidden in its text response without `<tool_call>` tags. On P11 it correctly calls `search_files`. But P12 remains a failure: it calls `get_weather("Antwerp")` despite the weather being provided.

At 12,096 ms average latency and Agent Score 0.710, smollm3 sits between smollm2:1.7b (0.740, 1,626 ms) and the mid-tier models. The generational improvement from SmolLM2 is visible in multi-tool support (1.000) and higher raw action rate, but the restraint regression offsets it in the composite score.

### lfm2.5:1.2b (1.2B) -- From "Wrong Format" to Tied #1

Liquid AI's state-space hybrid model was recommended by 3 users, with one calling it "a fantastic job for its size." Initially it scored 0.640 with Action 0.100 -- only 1 of 10 actionable prompts produced a parsed tool call. After adding a [bracket-notation fallback parser](#parser-improvements), it jumped to **0.880** -- tied for #1 with qwen3:0.6b, qwen3:4b, and phi4-mini.

The model was always making correct tool-calling decisions. It consistently chose the right tool with the right arguments, but expressed them in Python-style bracket notation (`[get_weather(city="Antwerp")]`) instead of the expected `<tool_call>` XML tags. Only 1 of 36 responses happened to use the standard format. Once the parser could read its output, the model's true capabilities emerged:

- **Action 0.700** -- correct tool on 7 of 10 actionable prompts, matching qwen3:0.6b and phi4-mini.
- **Restraint 1.000** -- perfect. Declined P5 (meta question) and P9 (code request) in all runs.
- **Wrong Tool 0** -- zero penalized wrong calls on the hard prompts.
- **Multi-Tool 1.000** -- correctly handles comma-separated multi-tool calls in bracket notation (`[search_files(pattern="*.py"), get_weather(city="Paris")]`).
- **Fastest at the 0.880 tier** -- 1,470 ms average, half the latency of qwen3:0.6b (3,645 ms) and 3.7x faster than phi4-mini (5,460 ms).

At 1.2B parameters, it's the smallest model tied for #1. It's also the only non-transformer architecture in the top tier -- a state-space hybrid (Mamba-derived). This suggests that transformer attention isn't a prerequisite for tool-calling judgment; the architecture can handle the pattern-matching and contextual reasoning that tool selection requires.

Where it falls short: P4 (implicit weather check for Brussels trip) is inconsistent -- sometimes it calls `get_weather`, sometimes it provides general travel advice without a tool call. P10 (cycling in Bruges), P11 (negation test), and P12 (weather already provided) are all declined rather than attempted. Like qwen3:0.6b, its strategy is conservative: when uncertain, don't act. Under this benchmark's scoring formula, that conservatism is rewarded.

The three users who recommended lfm2.5 on Reddit were right about its capability. The original 0.640 score reflected a format mismatch, not a reasoning deficit.

### jan-v3:4b (4B) -- Format Fix Reveals a Zero-Restraint Aggressive Caller

Jan v3-4B is a Qwen3 fine-tune from jan.ai. It initially scored 0.490 -- second to last -- because the model omits the opening `<tool_call>` tag, causing the parser to miss nearly every tool call. After adding a [bare-JSON fallback parser](#parser-improvements), its true behavior is visible: Agent Score **0.560**, still in the bottom third, but now the low score reflects genuine judgment issues rather than format compliance failure.

With parsing fixed, jan-v3 reveals one of the highest Action Scores in the benchmark:

- **Action 0.900** -- correct tool on 9 of 10 actionable prompts, matching bitnet-2B-4T and llama3.2:3b for the joint highest.
- **Restraint 0.000** -- zero. Calls a tool on every single prompt, including P5 and P9.
- **Wrong Tool 1** -- calls `get_weather` on P12 (weather already provided).

The model correctly handles P10 (`get_weather` for Bruges cycling) and P11 (`search_files` despite the "weather" keyword) -- two of the three hardest prompts. Only 8 of 21 models pass P11's negation test, and jan-v3 is one of them. Its Qwen3 fine-tuning gives it strong tool selection on individual prompts.

But it has zero restraint. When asked "What tools do you have?" (P5), it calls all three tools with fabricated demo data (`get_weather("New York")`, `search_files("*.txt")`, `schedule_meeting("Project Review")`), apparently interpreting the meta question as a request to demonstrate each tool. When asked to write a Python weather script (P9), it calls `get_weather` instead. This is the same failure pattern as llama3.2:3b (Restraint 0.000) and granite3.3:2b (Restraint 0.000) -- models that treat every prompt as a tool-calling opportunity.

The model also requires `think=False` to produce any output at all. With thinking enabled (default), all content goes to the `thinking` field and `content` is empty. It also occasionally uses `"arg1"` instead of proper parameter names (P4: `{"arg1": "Brussels"}` instead of `{"city": "Brussels"}`).

At 0.560, jan-v3 sits in the bottom third. Its high Action Score is offset by zero restraint and one wrong tool call. The model has the capability to select correct tools but lacks the judgment to know when not to act.

### granite3.3:2b (2B) -- Tool-Calling Machine Without Brakes

IBM's earlier Granite 3.3 scored 0.480, with zero restraint: it calls a tool on every single prompt, including P5 (meta question) and P9 (code-writing request). On P5, Run 2 called *all three tools simultaneously* with fabricated arguments. Almost every response has empty `raw_content` -- the model produces no natural language, just tool calls.

Despite this, its Action Score (0.700) reflects decent tool selection on the easy prompts and P10 (correctly calling `get_weather("Bruges")`). But the zero restraint and a wrong tool call on P12 give it the lowest score among functional models with native tool support.

The contrast with granite4:3b (0.670) shows clear generational improvement. Same company, similar size, but granite4 has restraint on P5, contextual awareness on P11, and natural language responses when appropriate.

### llama3.2:1b (1B) -- Most Chaotic Outputs in the Benchmark

The smallest Llama 3.2 scored 0.430 -- dead last. It has Action 0.700 (calls tools aggressively and often picks the right one for easy prompts), but Wrong Tool 3 (the maximum possible) and partial restraint failure make it unreliable.

Its outputs are the most chaotic in the benchmark:
- P5: Calls `get_weather` with hallucinated cities (London, Berlin, Antwerp -- different each run).
- P9: Outputs raw Python code with leaked `<|python_tag|>` tokens from Llama's training.
- P10: Calls `schedule_meeting` with fabricated attendees (`"client@bruguesurfers.com"`, `"anotherclient@bruguesurfers.com"`).
- P11: Calls `get_weather("")` with an empty city string, plus `search_files("*.csv")` -- searches for CSVs instead of a quarterly report.

Every hard prompt produces the worst possible tool call. On P10 it schedules a meeting that already exists (WRONG). On P11 it checks the weather after being told not to (WRONG). On P12 it re-checks weather already provided (WRONG). At 1B parameters with llama3.2's architecture, the model can produce valid tool-call JSON but has no judgment about what to put in it.

## Score Changes for Original Models

All 11 original models were rerun fresh for Round 2. Some scores shifted significantly due to run-to-run variance in the 3-run majority voting:

| Model | Round 1 | Round 2 | Change | What Changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bitnet-2B-4T | 0.570 | 0.810 | +0.240 | P10: schedule_meeting (WRONG) -> (none); P12: get_weather (WRONG) -> schedule_meeting (OK). Two wrong tools eliminated. |
| smollm2:1.7b | 0.640 | 0.740 | +0.100 | P11: get_weather (WRONG) -> (none). One wrong tool eliminated. |
| phi4-mini:3.8b | 0.680 | 0.780 | +0.100 | P11: get_weather (WRONG) -> (none). One wrong tool eliminated. |
| qwen2.5:1.5b | 0.800 | 0.840 | +0.040 | Minor improvement in action. |
| qwen2.5:3b | 0.670 | 0.670 | 0.000 | Stable. |
| llama3.2:3b | 0.660 | 0.660 | 0.000 | Stable. |
| ministral-3:3b | 0.800 | 0.800 | 0.000 | Stable. |
| deepseek-r1:1.5b | 0.600 | 0.720 | +0.120 | Parser fix: bare funcall parser now reads `get_weather(Antwerp)` format. Perfect restraint, 0 wrong tools, but inconsistent action (0.300). |
| gemma3:1b | 0.600 | 0.550 | -0.050 | Parser fix: funcall-in-tags parser now reads `<tool_call>get_weather(city: Antwerp)</tool_call>`. Revealed P5 restraint failure and wrong tools on P10/P12. Score *dropped* because old parser blindness was flattering restraint. |
| bitnet-3B | 0.600 | 0.600 | 0.000 | Stable (incoherent in both rounds). |
| qwen2.5:0.5b | 0.640 | 0.640 | 0.000 | Stable. |

The largest shift is bitnet-2B-4T (+0.240). In Round 1, it called `schedule_meeting` on P10 (penalized wrong tool) and `get_weather` on P12 (penalized wrong tool). In the Round 2 rerun, it declined P10 and correctly called `schedule_meeting` on P12. Whether the model calls the wrong tool vs. declines depends on stochastic sampling -- 3 runs is enough to produce stable results on easy prompts but not on the hard prompts where behavior is already borderline.

This variance affects primarily the Wrong Tool metric, which contributes 30% of the Agent Score. Models that are "on the edge" on hard prompts will fluctuate between runs.

## Cross-Model Findings

### P12 Remains the Hardest Prompt

"The weather in Antwerp is 8°C and rainy. Should I schedule an indoor meeting with Jan?" -- 3 of 21 models called the correct tool (`schedule_meeting`): qwen2.5:1.5b, llama3.2:3b, and bitnet-2B-4T. Eleven models called `get_weather` (the penalized wrong tool), including gemma3:1b and smollm3:3b which now register as WRONG with the improved parsers. Seven models declined entirely, including lfm2.5:1.2b which conservatively avoids the trap.

P12 requires three capabilities simultaneously: reading provided context (weather is known), resisting a keyword trigger ("weather"), and identifying the actual requested action (scheduling). No model under 1.5B parameters gets this right.

### The Negation Test (P11) Separates Families

"Don't check the weather in Antwerp, just find me the quarterly report." -- 11 models correctly called `search_files`:

| Model | Size | P11 Result |
|---|---|---|
| qwen3:0.6b | 0.6B | search_files OK |
| qwen3:1.7b | 1.7B | search_files OK |
| qwen3:4b | 4B | search_files OK |
| qwen2.5:3b | 3B | search_files OK |
| granite4:3b | 3B | search_files OK |
| bitnet-2B-4T | 2B | search_files OK |
| llama3.2:3b | 3B | search_files OK |
| jan-v3:4b | 4B | search_files OK |
| deepseek-r1:1.5b | 1.5B | search_files OK |
| gemma3:1b | 1B | search_files OK |
| smollm3:3b | 3B | search_files OK |

All three Qwen3 sizes pass P11, as do both larger Qwen2.5, Granite4, and jan-v3 (now visible with the fixed parser). The improved parsers also revealed that deepseek-r1, gemma3, and smollm3 pass P11 -- their correct `search_files` calls were previously invisible. The models that fail P11 by calling `get_weather` (qwen2.5:0.5b, functiongemma, llama3.2:1b, granite3.3:2b) all have either very small parameter counts or were designed without negation training.

### Thinking Mode: A Double-Edged Sword

Four models in Round 2 have thinking capability: qwen3:0.6b, qwen3:1.7b, qwen3:4b, and smollm3:3b. Their thinking adds latency but doesn't consistently improve judgment:

| Model | Agent Score | Avg Latency | Latency/Score Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| qwen3:0.6b | 0.880 | 3,645 ms | 4,142 ms/point |
| qwen3:4b | 0.880 | 63,717 ms | 72,406 ms/point |
| smollm3:3b | 0.710 | 12,096 ms | 17,036 ms/point |
| qwen3:1.7b | 0.670 | 11,903 ms | 17,766 ms/point |

qwen3:0.6b achieves the best latency/score ratio of any thinking model. qwen3:4b spends 17x more time thinking for the same score. smollm3:3b's thinking traces show correct reasoning that fails in execution -- it identifies the right tool but doesn't wrap the call in proper tags.

For tool calling specifically, longer thinking chains don't appear to help. The decisions are fast pattern matches (which tool fits this prompt?), not multi-step reasoning problems. The thinking overhead is mostly wasted on prompts where the answer is obvious, and doesn't rescue the model on prompts where the answer requires contextual understanding that the model lacks.

### Format Compliance Is Solvable -- And Solving It Changes Rankings

Across two rounds of parser improvements, five models were affected by format compliance issues. The fixes revealed three distinct outcomes: one model was genuinely excellent, two improved modestly, and two actually scored *worse* when the parser could finally see what they were doing.

| Model | Initial Score | After Parser Fix | What Changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| lfm2.5:1.2b | 0.640 (Action 0.100) | **0.880** (Action 0.700) | Bracket notation `[tool(args)]` now parsed. Jumped from rank 13 to tied #1. |
| jan-v3:4b | 0.490 (Action 0.100) | **0.560** (Action 0.900) | Bare JSON now parsed. Real problem visible: zero restraint, not format compliance. |
| deepseek-r1:1.5b | 0.600 (Action 0.000) | **0.720** (Action 0.300) | Bare funcall `get_weather(Antwerp)` now parsed. Perfect restraint, but very inconsistent action. |
| smollm3:3b | 0.740 (Action 0.600) | **0.710** (Action 0.900) | Bare funcalls now parsed. Action improved but revealed P5 restraint failures. Net score *decreased*. |
| gemma3:1b | 0.600 (Action 0.000) | **0.550** (Action 0.500) | Funcall-in-tags `<tool_call>fn(args)</tool_call>` now parsed. Revealed trigger-happy behavior and wrong tools. Net score *decreased*. |

The lfm2.5 case remains the most striking: a model that appeared mediocre was actually tied for the best in the benchmark. Its bracket notation was a perfectly consistent, well-structured output format -- just not the one the parser expected.

The gemma3 and smollm3 cases demonstrate the opposite phenomenon: **parser blindness can flatter a model's score**. Both models were calling tools on restraint prompts (P5) and picking wrong tools on hard prompts, but the old parser couldn't see those calls, so they appeared to have perfect restraint. Once the parser could read their function-call syntax, the true behavior emerged -- and it was worse than the format-blind score suggested.

deepseek-r1:1.5b is the clearest "format was the real problem" case after lfm2.5. The model has perfect restraint, zero wrong tools, and genuine comprehension -- but its bare function-call format is so inconsistent (different syntax each run) that only 3 of 10 actionable prompts produce parseable calls across majority voting.

The broader lesson is nuanced: benchmarks that rely on format compliance don't just *underestimate* models; they can also *overestimate* them. The direction of the error depends on whether the model's hidden behavior was good (lfm2.5, deepseek-r1) or bad (gemma3, smollm3).

### Speed vs. Judgment Frontier

| Model | Agent Score | Avg ms | Param |
|---|---|---|---|
| functiongemma | 0.640 | 476 | 270M |
| qwen2.5:0.5b | 0.640 | 881 | 500M |
| lfm2.5:1.2b | 0.880 | 1,470 | 1.2B |
| deepseek-r1:1.5b | 0.720 | 1,672 | 1.5B |
| bitnet-2B-4T | 0.810 | 2,036 | 2B |
| qwen2.5:1.5b | 0.840 | 2,211 | 1.5B |
| qwen3:0.6b | 0.880 | 3,645 | 600M |
| granite4:3b | 0.670 | 2,402 | 3B |

The speed-vs-judgment frontier shifted dramatically with the parser fixes. lfm2.5:1.2b achieves the best Agent Score (0.880) at 1,470 ms -- faster than qwen3:0.6b (3,645 ms) and far faster than the other models tied at 0.880. deepseek-r1:1.5b also improved its position: 0.720 at 1,672 ms makes it competitive in the sub-2s bracket. The Pareto frontier for "fastest at each score level" runs through functiongemma (0.640/476ms) and lfm2.5:1.2b (0.880/1,470ms).

For latency-critical deployments under 1 second, functiongemma and qwen2.5:0.5b are the only options, both at 0.640. For sub-2 second deployments, lfm2.5:1.2b (1,470ms, 0.880) is the best option.

## Conclusions

1. **Four models share the top spot -- and the fastest is a 1.2B state-space hybrid.** lfm2.5:1.2b, qwen3:0.6b, qwen3:4b, and phi4-mini:3.8b all score 0.880. After fixing the parser for lfm2.5's bracket-notation output, it went from rank 13 to tied #1 -- at 1,470 ms, it's the fastest model at the top tier by a wide margin (qwen3:0.6b takes 3,645 ms). The fact that a non-transformer architecture matches the best transformers at this scale is a notable result.

2. **Parameter count is a weak predictor of tool-calling quality.** Rankings within the Qwen3 family are non-monotonic: 0.6B (0.880) > 4B (0.880) > 1.7B (0.670). lfm2.5 at 1.2B ties models up to 3.8B. functiongemma (270M) ties with qwen2.5:0.5b (500M). llama3.2:1b (1B) scores lower than qwen3:0.6b (600M). Architecture and training data composition appear to matter more than raw size for tool-calling judgment in the sub-4B range.

3. **Purpose-built doesn't mean best.** functiongemma was fine-tuned specifically for function calling. It achieved the fastest latency (476 ms) and perfect restraint, but fell into the same keyword traps as generic models on the hard prompts (Wrong Tool 2). Fine-tuning for tool-call format compliance doesn't appear to help with contextual judgment about *which* tool to call.

4. **Generational improvement is real.** granite3.3:2b (0.480) vs granite4:3b (0.670); smollm2:1.7b (0.740) vs smollm3:3b (0.740, matching score but with Multi-Tool 1.000). Both IBM and HuggingFace show clear improvements between model generations on the same task.

5. **Format compliance is a separate axis from reasoning capability -- and fixing it changes rankings in both directions.** After adding five fallback parsers across two rounds, the impact varied dramatically by model. lfm2.5 jumped from rank 13 to tied #1 (0.640 → 0.880) and deepseek-r1 improved from 0.600 to 0.720 -- both were genuinely good models hidden behind format issues. But gemma3 (0.600 → 0.550) and smollm3 (0.740 → 0.710) actually scored *worse* because the parser fix revealed they were calling tools on restraint prompts and picking wrong tools -- behavior the old parser couldn't see. The lesson: format-blind benchmarks don't just underestimate models; they can also overestimate them by hiding bad behavior behind parsing failures.

6. **3-run majority voting has high variance on edge cases.** bitnet-2B-4T shifted from 0.570 to 0.810 between Round 1 and Round 2 reruns, entirely due to different outcomes on P10 and P12. The hard prompts are where this variance concentrates, because models that are borderline on a prompt will flip between calling the right tool, the wrong tool, or no tool depending on sampling. More runs would stabilize these scores, at the cost of longer benchmark time.

7. **The conservative strategy still wins under this scoring formula.** The top 3 models (qwen3:0.6b, qwen3:4b, qwen2.5:1.5b) all have the same pattern: perfect restraint, zero wrong tools, moderate Action. The formula gives 60% combined weight to restraint and wrong-tool-avoidance, structurally favoring models that decline uncertain prompts. Under an action-maximizing formula (e.g., Action x 0.7 + Restraint x 0.15 + WTA x 0.15), aggressive models like bitnet-2B-4T (Action 0.900) and llama3.2:3b (Action 0.900) would rank higher. The "right" formula depends on the deployment context: autonomous agents should be conservative; human-in-the-loop agents can be aggressive.

8. **The community-requested models mostly confirmed the original findings -- with one major surprise.** The Qwen family dominance extended from Qwen2.5 to Qwen3. The keyword-trap failure pattern on P11/P12 appeared in the new models at similar rates. No new model broke the P12 barrier (only 3 of 21 get it right). The most surprising result isn't qwen3:0.6b (a strong model from a strong family) but lfm2.5:1.2b -- a state-space hybrid that was initially dismissed as a format failure but turned out to be tied for the best model in the benchmark. The three Reddit users who recommended it were right; the benchmark just needed a parser that could understand its output.
